**DRAMA**  
**THE ELEMENTS OF DRAMA**  
The playwright is called the adresser,a written text(a play) is called message;actors,directors,designers,musicians are called performance;the audience is the addressee.  
**THE STRUCTURE OF A DRAMATIC TEXT**  
In Shakrspear’s plays are mede up of 5 acts:  
introduction,development,crisis/turning point,complication,resolution;sometimes there is a prologue or an epilogue.A one act-play has only one act.  
**DRAMATIC TECHNIQUES**  
The dialogue is the main support of drama since:it creates actions,provides details about the characters and their relationships,shows what character believes about an another,gives informations about past and can foreshow the events,contributes to the development of themes and ideas that are important to the play.There are also asides,that are comments made by characters for the audience alone.Stage directions are instructions given by a director to the characters.

**THE CHARACTERS**  
Usually there is an hero and an antagonist.The hero does not have to be brave or noble but could also be doubtful.A character is presented by dialogues,monologues,asides and stage directions,a character can change thought the events of the play.  
**LANGUAGE**  
It usually intense and varied as it can feature parts of everydays speech,poetry or prose.    
**NARRATIVE TEXT**  
**FEATURES OF NARRATIVE TEXT**  
The most common form of fiction as a genre,the novel,emerged in its **modern form in 18th century in Europe**(with poets such as:Verga,Pirandello and many more).In England the novel **was not associated with the aristocracy but with the rising middle class**.The novel is written in **prose,rather then verse**,but it does also **include poetic elements**.The novel is a narrative:it **tells a story**.It has **characters,action and a plot**.It involves people who act in a context ruled by some sort of connective logic.The author belongs to a tradition of shared conventions and codes.**The author addresses the text to a reader of his time but also to an ideal reader from no specific time**.The narrator is speaking voice and the narratee is the addressee of the narration.  
**THE STORY AND PLOT**  
The narrative text is made of a **sequence of events called story,these events are not always presented in chronological order:an author could use flashbacks and  anticipation**.The original sequence of events is called plot.  
Usually there are 4 stages:

* **Introduction** of the situation  
* the **breakdown** of the initial situation  
* the **development** of the story to the climax  
* the **end**,where the initial situation can ben **changed** or **restored**

**SETTING**  
is the **place and time of the story**  
**CINEMATIC TECHNIQUE**  
The **cinematic novelists anticipated the cinema**,since their works were published before the film had evolved.Throughout the **19th century**,novelist cultivated the **camera eye and camera movement**,*moving into their subjects using zoom-like techniques followed by close-ups from the city into the street*,*from the street into house,taking the reader from room to room*.*The wide,panoramic,aerial views are characteristic way of introducing an action they may be birds’s eye,that is,not too high,simply from elevated ground.*The narration **resembles motion-pictures as it unfolds in a series of images** in which the characters and objects are described and seen in different positions,sometimes in quick succession,since people move up into middle distance or foreground,or alternatively recede and diminish.  
**THE NARRATOR**  
an essential element of the narrative text is the **speaking voice**,who’s **not the author but narrator**,he is **not always the author of the book.**The narrator is the **voice that tells the story** and **gives the point of view** from which the story is told.The narrator could be **internal or external**.It can be a first or third person narrator.  
**FIRST-PERSON NARRATOR**  
the first person narrator employs the “**I”mod**e;it can **coincide with a characte**r in the story or with **the protagonist** who tells about his life.This narrator can:

* **bring  the reader close to the mind  and feelings of the narrator**  
* **convey an impression of reality**  
* **restrict the reader’s perspective**

**THIRD-PERSON NARRATOR**  
tells the story **from outside**,He can be **obtrusive when he makes personal remarks and digressions**(for example the unknown from the Promessi Sposi)**or provides a comment on society of the time or on some characters**.The narrator is **unobtrusive when he does not make comments about the story**.  
**OMNISCIENT NARRATOR**  
Is a narrator **that knows the feelings and thoughts of every character in the story**,an author could bring all the characters to life and allow different voices to interpret the events while also keeping a distance.  
**NARRATIVES MODES**  
*dialogue,description and narration*  
**POV**  
is the **angle from which the scenes is described and the story told**.It is influenced by the kind of narrator.It can be the **pov of one of the characters or a neutral pov.**  
**CHARACTERS**  
*presented:*

* **directly**  
* **indirectly**

*can be:*

* **major**  
* **minor**  
* **round** grow and develop during the vents of the story(like Renzo in the Promessi Sposi)  
* **flat** or types or caricatures they do not change during the events of the story

**THEME**  
is **the idea the author tries to convey**. can be **explicit** or can be either consciously intended and indicated by the author, **or discovered by the reader.** The theme contains the message whose interpretation leads to an understanding of the meaning of the text.  
**PRE-CELTIC BRITAIN**   
**Six thousand years** ago the land now called ‘Britain’ was **already inhabited.**These people did not have boat so they arrived crossing the strait of Dover ,that was not covered by water,on foot.  
The population began to ***burn and cut down the forests, to row cereals like wheat, barley or oats, and to breed cattle, Pigs and sheep.*** Over the course of four centuries they c**hanged the landscape, and from about 3000 BC they built ritual Sites**, large, enclosed spaces used both for ceremonies and for defence.During the Bronze Age (ca 2500-1000 BC) the **islanders started metalworking, Producing pottery and salt,** and manufacturing **leather and cloth**, which they also traded overseas.  
**STONEHENGE**  
Our ancestor use to build **simple temples** and structures with only stone wich were called **Menhir**,that was a stone block place in the ground vertically,and **Dolmen**,that was made up of two menhir and an horizontal rock placed on top on them.The first stone circles **made up from** **Menhir and Dolmen were called Cromletch**.The most important of the is stonehenge.Its name comes from **stone+henge** which comes from the verb to hang.It is **located in Annesbury in England**.It was probably **built between 2500-1000BC**.Its original **architect is unknown**.Probably it was a temple **dedicated to the su**n,as the rising sun places it self on top of the altar on the morning of the winter’s solstice.It is **33m large** and each stone is on average **4m tall**.The stile in which this structure was built is obviously **paleolitic**.I find really interesting to look at how the cromletch has preserved itself through the thousands of years.  
**THE CELTS**  
Around **700BC** the Celts began to arrive from the **northwest of Germany and gradually settled in the country**.Today their language is **still spoken**:in Wales we have Welsh andGaelic in Scotland and Ireland.They were tall nad muscular,with fair skin,blue eyes and blond eyes.They were farmers,hunters,fishermen and metal workers.Today is **still possible to admire the long narrow pattern of Celtic fields**.They also built massive **hill forts** on top hills,and sometimes **surrounded them with ditches**,sometimes also **filled with water**.These fortress were used as **tribal centres   and refuges in times of danger**.**Women were equal to men**:they could choose the man they wanted to marry and retained their own property.They could also lead warriors in wars:an example of women **general was Boadice**,who was a queen who **fought against the Romans**.She ruled over Iceni tribe in EastAnglia alongside with her husband.Boudicea was a **striking looking** women according to accounts,she was very tall,had an harsh voice,had a mass of reddest hair fell down to her hips.The **Druids** were the Celts’ priests,they did not only **dedicated to religion but also to justice,education,medicine and culture in general**;they held ceremonies in the **heart of the wood and not in temples**.They worshipped **natural elements** such as **water**  that was also the door for another world according to them.We have many Romans accounting about the Celts,because they were **fought by both Cesar and Claudius**,the first was not able to conquer the British Island because he had to head back to Rome as the civil war was starting;the second was able to conquer the modern territories of England and Wales but he was not able to conquer Scotland and Ireland(another interesting thing is that the Romans referred to Ireland as Scotland because it was inhabited by the Scots that will then transfer in the modern day Scotland;they referred to modern day Scotland as Pictia as it was inhabited by the pictis).**All the accounts we have about the Celts written by the Romans describe them as a barbaric population which used to do human sacrifices and other terrible things**,**but in reality they did not**,and were a pretty advanced population which had respect of women and nature.  
**THE DRUIDS**  
The first to talk about the druids was **Cesar** in his **de bello gallico**,in which he **described the tradition of the various population he fought against** during his war against during the conquest of Gallia.According to Caesar the Druids **did not take part in wars and were exempt from military taxes and enlistment**.They **studied lore,philosophy,astrology,medicine** and many other subjects.They  did also **use of the Greek alphabet** in different spheres of their public and private life.Caesar's most terrifying accounting is the **practice of human sacrifice**.**Tacitus** also wrote about the druids.He said that **during the attack to the island of Mona the Roman army met the opposing army which included women dressed in black and druids**.The druids were raising their hands to the sky and chanting dreadful imprecations that **terrified the roman soldier**.He also said that the druids were **devoted to inhumane superstitions,such as covering the altars with the enemy’s blood**.Also **Cicero** record his experience with the druids of Gaul.In his **de divinatione**, he states that he **had met a gallic druid from the tribe of Aedui**,and said that this druid **knew many things about nature and performed divination by reading auguries**.**Strabo’s Geography** provides another account of the druid’s role in society.he said that among the Gauls the druids **held 3 honourable positions**:the first position of the **bards(barboi)**,was made up singers and poets who retold tales and legends,they were the celtic version of the aoidos(aedo).**The second position was that druids possessed a special knowledge of natural world and practised divination**.The last was that they were **philosophers**.Then **Pliny the elder,in his de naturalis historia**,noticed the abundance of the plant of **mistletoe in Druidic ceremonies**.He said that the plant **was sacred and always employed in rituals**.He **notes that also the oak was sacred**,for them everything that came from **oak came directly from the heaven** and the appearance of mistletoe was proof that **three was divine**.He also said that the druids were cannibals.**Diodorus Siculus** also gives a short accountance about druids in his **Bibliotheca Historica**.He described the **druidic order** and their roles in society.**He noted that they were singers,bards and theologians**.Some writings about the druids appeared **only after the Christianization of the British Island** by Saint Augustine,the father of the christian philosophy,with his Scolastica,he tried to prove existence of god with rational thinking.Those accountancy **from Ireland and Wales were written by monks** and not by druids so the can not be accurate.**The Irish accountancy described the druids as in posses of supernatural abilities**.In this literature,the druids became more connected with magic power and divination than the real ancestors really were.Most description of the druids by **Welsh writes are from 10th century and did not connect with the other more reliable sources.**  
**THE ROMANS**  
The first to lead a full scale invasion of the british island **Caesar between 55-54** Bc but he was not able to finish is campaign and **had to withdraw his troops from the island and head back to Rome as the civil war against Pompeus was starting**.Then emperor **Claudius between 43-47AD** was able to fully conquer Britain.The first invasion by Caesar was lead by his craving for glory but the second invasion was made because the Romans were attracted by the rich agriculture of the South of England.**They did not control the entire island as they were never able to conquer Scotland which was under the rule of the Picts tribes**(another interesting thing is that the Romans referred to Ireland as Scotland because it was inhabited by the Scots that will then transfer in the modern day Scotland;they referred to modern day Scotland as Pictia as it was inhabited by the picts).And **in 122AD emperor Adrian ordered to built a big wall whose name is Adrian’s wall,parts of this wall are still visible today**.(*"I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I’ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great great wall on our southern border and I’ll have Mexico pay for that wall."***)**The Romans built **many km of paved roads** around the entire country.They also **built many castra** and from them many British cities such as:Manchester(is full of shit),Lancaster,Leincester,Wincester and Gloucester.**But the most important city was Londinium modern-day London,there they built a bridge crossing river Thames**.They brought there the **latin language** from which many english words came from,and also Cristianity,In **409 Ad the soldiers were withdrawn from the island** to the defend Rome from the barbarian attacks.	  
**THE ANGLO-SAXONS**  
Between **5th and 6th** centuries the British islands were **raided by some population coming from Germany and Northern Europe**,those people then started to settled in England were they built a **system of 7 kingdoms called Heptarchy,those kingdom were:Wessex,Essex,Mercia,Northumbria,EastAnglia,Kent and Sussex.**They r**eintroduced the pagan value**s but in **597 Pope Gregory I send a monk called Augustine**(the father of the christian philosophy,with his Scolastica,he tried to prove existence of god with rational thinking,then became saint) **to convert the anglo-saxons to Christianity**.Then 602 the cathedral of Canterbury was founded and Augustine became the first Archbishop.  
**THE DANES**   
While the Anglosaxons were framers the **Danes were sea people**.They c**rossed the Atlantic ocean with their longships.**They used to **sack monasteries**,they destroyed hundreds of manuscripts and took the **monks as slaves**.When they **settled in England** they **established Danelaw**.Their **language blended with that of local population** and with can still find traces of this language in **names of places ending in \-thorpe,-kirk and \-by**.When they tried to conquer Wessex they **met opposition of king Ethelred and his brother Alfred**.When Ethelered died his brother **Alfred became king of Wessex.He defeated the Danes in the battle of Edington**.He built fortesses and planned a navy with longships.He **made Wincester capital of his kingdom**.He **ordered to translate latin text in anglo-saxon and the commissioned the writing of the book Anglosaxon Chronicles**.He built many new churches.He created a **new legal code** .After him the next king were **Edward**(his son) and **Athelsan**(his granson).In **991 the vikings organized another attack but they were payed to stop**.This event marked the begging of the end of anglosaxon kingdom.In **1066 king Harold will defeat the vikings but won’t win William the conqueror,Duke of Normandy,who will then become the first ever king of England.**
